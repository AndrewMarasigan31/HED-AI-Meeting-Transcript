Hi Everyone,

Thanks for your time today. Please find below a summary of key discussion points and action items from our recent meeting. 

Meeting Notes

Discussion on the upcoming summer campaign launch and the quiet performance of the MCLA campaign, with a plan to bundle its budget into the main summer campaign.

Update on the Art Pass campaign, including copy approval with the gallery, and a request for negative keywords to prevent cannibalization with other campaigns.

Strategy discussion for A/B testing a new ad-focused landing page for Data Dreams on both Google and Meta to compare conversion rates.

Review of Google campaign performance, highlighting improved cost per conversion for Data Dreams and shopping campaigns, and a continued struggle with tablet performance.

Consideration of a new search campaign for a high-priced New Year's Eve party at the MCA, weighing budget implications and recommending a Meta-heavy approach with a small Google search component.

Updates on Meta campaign performance for Membership, Data Dreams, Up Late, and the Christmas campaign, detailing reach, impressions, clicks, purchases, and CPA figures.

Discussion on optimizing the Christmas campaign copy to include shipping cutoff dates for conversion ads and late-night shopping hours for traffic ads, aiming to drive both online and in-store purchases.

Addressing Meta platform updates that affect the timeline for making creative changes to campaigns due to increased manual steps.

Suggestion to target high-value donors for the New Year's Eve party campaign, leveraging a Mailchimp list if accessible, due to the high ticket price point.

Key Decisions

The MCLA campaign budget will be bundled into the main summer campaign after the summer campaign launch.

A/B testing will be conducted for the Data Dreams landing page on Google, using two ads with the same copy but different landing pages to compare conversions.

A/B testing for the Data Dreams landing page will also be performed on Meta, potentially isolating it to the Sydney region to minimize disruption and get quicker results.

For the New Year's Eve party campaign, a strategy focusing heavily on Meta with a small budget allocation for targeted Google search terms was agreed upon, acknowledging high CPCs for NYE.

An initial budget of 2k will be allocated to the New Year's Eve party campaign on Meta to gauge traction, with potential for increased budget if performance is positive but constrained.

Shipping cutoff dates will be added to the copy of conversion ads for the Christmas campaign.

Late-night shopping information will be added to the copy of traffic ads for the Christmas campaign.
