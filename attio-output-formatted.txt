Meeting Notes

The team discussed the upcoming summer campaign presentation scheduled for 4pm with the director, with plans to launch the animated hero asset for Meta and go live this week pending approval.

MCLA campaign status was reviewed, with the decision to potentially switch off the campaign after this week and bundle its budget into the main summer campaign once it launches, pending a Monday meeting confirmation.

Art Pass campaign progress was covered, including copy approval waiting from the gallery (Claire) and the need for negative keywords to prevent cannibalization with the Data Dreams campaign.

A new Data Dreams landing page testing strategy was planned, involving A/B testing between the existing information-dense page and a new conversion-focused page across both Google and Meta platforms.

The MCA New Year's Eve party campaign was discussed as a new opportunity, featuring rooftop party and restaurant dinner experiences with $700 tickets, requiring budget considerations and targeting donor/ambassador lists due to the high price point.

Christmas campaign optimization was addressed, including plans to add shipping cutoff dates to conversion ads and late-night shopping messaging to traffic ads, with strategic budget shifting from conversion to traffic ads after shipping becomes unrealistic.

Key Decisions

The MCLA campaign budget will be bundled into the main summer campaign once the summer campaign launches.
A/B testing will be conducted separately on Google and Meta platforms for the new Data Dreams landing page.
Meta A/B testing will require rebuilding ads from scratch to ensure proper test setup.
Sydney region will be selected for initial Meta landing page testing due to higher conversion volume for faster results.
The New Year's Eve party campaign will focus primarily on Meta with minimal Google spend due to high CPC costs.
Christmas campaign budget will shift more toward traffic ads rather than conversion ads once shipping becomes unrealistic.
Three different copy variations will be created for Christmas campaign ads focusing on order dates, late-night shopping, and shipping cutoffs.
Donor and ambassador lists will be targeted for the New Year's Eve party campaign due to the high $700 ticket price point alignment.
